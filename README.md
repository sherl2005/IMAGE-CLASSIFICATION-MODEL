- **Domain**: MACHINE LEARNING 
- **Duration**: 4 WEEKS  
- **Mentor**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR  

## Description

This repository contains the implementation of an **Image Classification Model** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in **Google Colab** as part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**. The objective of this project was to train a deep learning model to classify images into different categories.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Used**: CIFAR-10 / Custom Dataset
- **Libraries Used**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Image resizing and normalization
  - Data augmentation for improved generalization
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
- **Model Training**:
  - Built a **CNN model** using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`
  - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix
  - Visualization of model performance

## Output

Below are some visualizations from the implementation:

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-model.git
   ```
2. Open the `IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells sequentially to execute the image classification model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with **deep learning-based image classification** using **CNNs**. The model effectively categorized images, and further improvements can be made by experimenting with **transfer learning** (e.g., **ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet**) for better accuracy and efficiency.
